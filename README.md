1. The r, g, and b variables are floats because they can be fractional (unlike integers), and they are not text or true/false statements.
2. The bounce variable is an int because a ball cannot bounce a fraction of a time, and it is not text or true/false statements. 
3. I thought the correct option would be r+=0.1f, but it wasn't correct because it was missing a semicolon.
